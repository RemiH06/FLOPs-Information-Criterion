### General Description
I don't really trust AIC or BIC for some of my models. I understand there are many other criterions out there but I rather create my own for a new kind of comparison that has not been conceived. It makes a count of FLOPS and uses them in some formula I will come up with to determine models and even code efficiency in a fusion between statistics and IT.

```diff
- This is not concluded, might take a while if I don't hurry.
```

## Installation

1. Here I'll place the installation guide, may turn it into a pip package once I finish

## Features

- For now, you can compare models through FLOPs within basic_usage.py
